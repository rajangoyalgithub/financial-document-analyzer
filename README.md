🤖 AI Financial Document Analyzer - Debug Challenge
A multi-agent financial analysis system built with CrewAI, FastAPI, and Google Gemini. This project was completed as part of a technical debug challenge to transform a broken, "hallucinating" codebase into a professional investment tool.

🛠️ Bugs Found and Fixed
1. Hallucination & Ethics Bug (Critical)
Problem: The original agents were instructed to "make up facts" and recommend high-risk "meme stocks" regardless of the data.

Fix: Rewrote agent backstories in agents.py to enforce data-driven objectivity and added a Compliance Verifier Agent to cross-check all AI claims against the source document.

2. Broken Tool Logic (Technical)
Problem: The FinancialDocumentTool used an undefined Pdf class, making it impossible for the AI to read the uploaded files.

Fix: Integrated PyPDFLoader from langchain_community and implemented proper @tool decorators in tools.py to allow text extraction from PDFs.

3. API & Connection Bugs
Problem: The system lacked LLM initialization (causing crashes) and failed "CORS" checks (blocking browser requests).

Fix:

Initialized ChatGoogleGenerativeAI with secure environment variable support.

Added CORSMiddleware to main.py to enable seamless communication between the FastAPI backend and the Swagger UI frontend.
